# Chatbot Deployment with Flask and JavaScript


This gives 2 deployment options:
- Deploy within Flask app with jinja2 template
- Serve only the Flask prediction API. The used html and javascript files can be included in any Frontend application (with only a slight modification) and can run completely separate from the Flask App then.
